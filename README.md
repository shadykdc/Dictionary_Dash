## Problem:

Given two words (start and end), and a dictionary, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from start to end, such that:

Only one letter can be changed at a time.

Each intermediate word must exist in the dictionary For example, Given: start = “hit” end = “cog” dict = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"] As one shortest transformation is “hit” -> “hot” -> “dot” -> “dog” -> “cog”, return its length 5.

## How to run this program:

1. Unzip the folder.
2. Navigate to the executable location in the folder on the command line.
3. Type in: ./dictionary_dash [INPUT_FILE]

The following INPUT_FILEs are already available:
test0.txt
test1.txt
test2.txt
test3.txt
test4.txt
test5.txt
test6.txt
test7.txt
test9.txt

test8.txt was a blank file which couldn't be uploaded.

Additional input files can be created and should be formatted as follows:
```
first_word
second_word

dictionary_word_1
dictionary_word_2
...
```
